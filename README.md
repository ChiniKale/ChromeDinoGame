Things remaining to do:
1. Add Background Clounds and Small mountain in front of the BAT SIGNAL.
2. Different Sprites For different sizes of Cacti
3. Inverting Color After some Time (Add MOON/SUN? )
4. Add end-credits : just each of our names in an arcade-inspired font <br>

(ambitious) <br>
5. add a mars version - change the background to look like mars; add a photo of a rover; slightly increase the height jumpable and the time in air after every jump (the starup of this game must have the title: DinoMars - 1200000 BC) <br>
6. AI MODEL <br>
